<!-- BEGIN: AGENT-DELEGATION (managed by infiniteleverage skills — do not delete this block) -->
## Agent delegation (auto-routing)

When you receive a request, **delegate to the right specialist agent** before doing the work yourself. The 8 agents and their triggers:

| Agent | Delegate when the request involves… |
|---|---|
| **product-manager** | roadmap, vision, epics, daily plan, project-status.html, scope changes, approval triage, stakeholder updates, standup briefings |
| **developer** | writing/changing code, fixing bugs, refactoring, scaffolding pages, API endpoints, Supabase migrations, env-vars wiring |
| **qa** | testing, regression checks, browser matrix, accessibility, QA plans, "verify this works" |
| **devops** | CI/CD, deployments, secret management, infra escalations, Vercel/GitHub workflow issues |
| **designer** | UI mockups, brand application, image prompts, design system updates, visual reviews |
| **writer** | blog drafts, social copy, SEO briefs, voice/tone, content briefs |
| **web-publisher** | publishing markdown → Next.js components, updating `website/pages/blog/index.jsx`, image optimization, the publish workflow |
| **email-marketer** | email drafts, sequences, broadcast campaigns, Brevo/Resend, CRM segmentation |

**Delegation rules:**
1. Pick exactly **one** agent per turn — don't run two in parallel unless the operator explicitly says so.
2. If a request spans agents (e.g., "write a blog *and* publish it"), call them **in sequence**: writer → designer → web-publisher.
3. If unclear which agent fits, **ask the operator** before assuming.
4. Cross-cutting engineering rules live in `.claude/rules/global-engineering.md` — every agent honors them.
5. Project-level persona overrides for each agent live in `agents/<name>/context/persona.md` — read these on first invocation.
6. Trigger phrases: `@product-manager`, `@developer`, etc. — but auto-route even without the `@` when intent is clear.
